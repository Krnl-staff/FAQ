# Anti-virus Whitelist / Disabling Anti-virus
**Krnl, like ANY other roblox exploit will be marked as a virus, this is known as a "False postive" where windows thinks the "Krnl.dll" file is a virus due to it being obfuscated, rest assured Krnl is 100% safe.
You can actually decompile the entire UI using DN spy.**

Lets start by whitelisting Krnl from Window's anti-virus.

1.) Open Settings, and type "Windows security". It should open the windows security panel from there.

2.) Select the "Virus and Threat Protection" option.

3.) You'll want to navigate to [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/903380408597614623/1013506105420283934/unknown.png), Then disable the "Real Time Protection" option.


**(NOTE: IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TURN OFF YOUR WHOLE ANTI VIRUS BUT INSTEAD JUST WHITELIST/EXCLUDE KRNL, READ BELOW)**

- To whitelist Krnl begin from step 3 shown above, and instead of disabling "Real Time Protection", navigate to the bottom and look for "Add or Remove Exclusions" option.

- Select "Add an Exclusion" and select "Folder". From there, you can navigate to the Krnl folder and set it as a exclusion.


# Other Anti-viruses

You may have a anti-virus besides Window's anti-virus, depending on which one you have setting a exclusion or disabling it may be tricky. The steps below will demonstrate how to uninstall any third-party antiviruses you may have on your device.

1.) Press the windows key + R and type "appwiz.cpl"
